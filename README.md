## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- IP Geolocation API by IPify 
- LeafletJS (JavaScript library)

### What I learned

In this project i learnt how to use fetch method to make a server request and works with API in javascript, 
rendring the data that i got from the fetch request by manipulating the DOM and changing its value, and it was a great opportunity to learn how to create interactive maps using LeafletJS which is a JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
